# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is about fetching the headlines of various categories like general,entertainment, science, sports, technology etc.. from the API [https://newsapi.org/]

This project is made up of react, bootstrap and few others like react loading skeleton from materialUI, react-top-loading-bar(inspired from youtube) and react-infinite-scroll-component.

# SPECIAL NOTE:
This project is deployed in vercel. But the website is not supported in browsers.The problem seems to be that NewsApi made their service available ONLY for paying customers everybody else gets access only through their localhost. Their free plan is called "Developer Plan".SO to find my work how UI looks, it is better to clone the git and use it in your computer and run it in localhost.
